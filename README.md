# AirBnb-Seattle-Data-Analysis-Tableau-Project

# Project description

In this study, I analyzed bike sales data to gain insights into the various factors influencing customer purchase decisions. To achieve this, I generated pivot tables in Excel to examine the correlations among different variables, including income, gender, education, marital status, regions, and more. The following excerpt provides a glimpse of the conclusive dashboard created in Excel.
The data I used was taken from [Inside Airbnb Seattle](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), Washington, United States
