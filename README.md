Within this repository, you'll discover a Tableau workbook meticulously crafted for delving into the intricate world of Airbnb listings in Seattle. The primary aim of this endeavor is to uncover valuable insights into the myriad factors that wield influence over the pricing dynamics of Airbnb accommodations in the vibrant city of Seattle.
The data I used was taken from [Inside Airbnb Seattle](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), Washington, United States

Visual Exploration: Utilizing diverse visualizations, such as line charts and maps, I uncovered trends in booking prices, occupancy rates, and guest satisfaction.

Interactive Dashboard: Crafted an engaging dashboard with filters for personalized exploration, enhancing the user experience through thoughtful color schemes, labels, and tooltips.
